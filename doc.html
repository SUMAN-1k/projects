                <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the
                     wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the
                      modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be 
                      domesticatedby humans. Hunter-gatherers did this, over 15,000 years ago in Germany,
                      which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with
                       humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the 
                       ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
                      <br>
                    The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory 
                    capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.
                     They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, 
                     assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. 
                     Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine 
                     bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given 
                     them the sobriquet of "man's best friend"</p><br>

                     <p><b><u>LIFESPAN</u></b><br>
                        The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity
                         (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive)
                        ranges from 10 to 13 years. The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken 
                        as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs
                        when all breeds are averaged. For dogs in England, increased body weight
                        has been found to be negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, 
                        the shorter its lifespan), and mixed-breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than 
                        purebred dogs.<br>

                </header>
                <p>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in
                    Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence
                    shows that this dog was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago 
                    and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with 
                    red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of<
                    canine distemper.Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described 
                    as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because
                    considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.
                    <br><br>

                    This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the
                    time of hunter–gatherers, which predates agriculture. DNA sequences show that all tinct
                    wolf population which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.<br>
                    <br>
                    The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal
                     pathway into domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first
                    domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades. Genetic 
                    studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or
                    several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia.
                    In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was 
                    domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later 
                    dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia, with dogs 
                    likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.</p><br>

                <p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.
                    In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds,
                    which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.Most breeds were derived from small numbers
                    of founders within the last 200 years,and since then dogs have undergone rapid 
                    phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection
                    imposed by humans. <br>The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds,
                    with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order 
                    of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include 
                    body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. Their behavioural traits
                    include guarding, herding, and hunting,retrieving, and scent detection.<br>
                    Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression, which
                    demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.As a result, present day dogs
                    are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most 
                    striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage 
                    during the Victorian era.</p>

                        <p>Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip
                        dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees.
                        Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting
                         unspayed females of all breeds and ages, and Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat),
                        which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions
                        and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks,
                         mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms, which is a roundworm 
                        species that lives in the hearts of dogs.<br>

                            Several human foods and household ingestible are toxic to dogs, including chocolate 
                            solids, causing theobromine poisoning, onions and garlic, causing thiosulphate, 
                            sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning, grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, and xylitol
                            The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include
                            copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other symptoms are 
                            abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.<br>
                            <br>
                            Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, 
                            including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and 
                            arthritis.</p>

                        <p>Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the 
                            domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli. As the
                             oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia 
                             of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have
                             acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other 
                             species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientist
                             have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs. These
                              abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly 
                              intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's <br>
                              social-cognitive skills.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p><b>INTELLIGENCE</b><br>
                                Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as
                                 knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that

                                dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico,
                                a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items.
                                He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly 
                                retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial 
                                exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning
                                and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by
                                verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to
                                human body language such as gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands.<br>
                                 <br>
                                One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no modern
                                 exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. 
                                 One limited study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and 
                                 were more focused on the "what" of a task rather than the "where".</p>

                                 <p><b>COMMUNICATION</b><br>
                                Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand 
                                messages from humans and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.
                                 Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression,
                                [ vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs)and gustatory
                                 communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). Humans communicate
                                to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture, forming a 
                                complex interplay of signals that bridge the gap between species. The auditory 
                                aspect of this communication is particularly crucial, as dogs, with their acute
                                sense of hearing, rely on it for understanding and responding to various cues,
                                including the distinctive barking patterns that convey different messages.</p>
